# Selling Your IPv4 Address with [IPv4.Center](https://ipv4.center/sell-ipv4)

At **IPv4.Center**, we make selling IPv4 addresses simple and secure. We connect sellers with interested buyers, managing the entire process and ensuring that your sale is smooth and hassle-free. Our platform ensures transparency and efficiency while protecting your interests.

## How to Sell Your IPv4 Address

Here is an easy-to-follow workflow for selling your IPv4 address through our service:

### Step 1: Listing Your IPv4 Subnet

Once you decide to sell your IPv4 subnet, we will list your subnet in our inventory and offer it to potential buyers. Our team actively promotes your addresses to our network of interested buyers to find the best offers.

### Step 2: Receiving Offers

- When a buyer is interested in your subnet and makes an offer, we will immediately inform you.
- You can either accept or reject the offer. If you are not satisfied with the offer, we continue to seek better offers from other buyers.
- If you accept the offer, we proceed to the next steps to formalize the transaction.

### Step 3: Contract and Escrow Setup

Once you agree to the buyer’s offer:

- We prepare a contract that outlines the terms of the sale and send it to both you and the buyer for review and signatures.
- We set up an escrow.com transaction with a specific release condition. For example, this condition could be the successful transfer of the IPv4 subnet’s organization ID (e.g., ORG-xxx-RIPE) to the buyer.

### Step 4: Securing Payment

- The buyer transfers the agreed amount to escrow.com. This step ensures that the payment is secured before you deliver the IPv4 address.
- Once escrow.com confirms that the buyer’s funds are secure, you will be notified to proceed with the transfer of your IPv4 address.

### Step 5: Transfer Agreement

- A Transfer Agreement is created between you (the seller) and the buyer. This agreement is signed by both parties and forms the basis of the transfer request.
- After both sides have signed the Transfer Agreement, you initiate the Transfer Request with the regional internet registry (such as RIPE NCC).

### Step 6: Transfer Request on RIPE

- You create a Transfer Request on the RIPE NCC platform, submitting the necessary documentation and the signed Transfer Agreement.
- RIPE NCC will review and validate the transfer request. This process typically takes between 1 to 3 days.
- Once the transfer is approved, RIPE updates the registration, and the IPv4 addresses are transferred to the buyer.

### Step 7: Release of Payment

- After the transfer is completed and the specific release condition (e.g., ORG ID change) is met, escrow.com releases the payment to you.
- You will receive a closing statement from escrow.com, confirming that the funds are on their way to your bank account.
- Within 48 hours, the payment will be deposited into your account, finalizing the transaction.
